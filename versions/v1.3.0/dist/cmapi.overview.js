If items that the CMAPI indicates SHOULD or MUST be globally unique, or unique to an overlay, etc., are not in fact unique, “strange” behavior becomes a real possibility.  Although guaranteeing true global uniqueness is not possible, to achieve the highest probable possibility of global uniqueness, identifiers SHOULD use UUID (also referred to as GUID) formatted identifiers generated according to RFC 4122 (<a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt\">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt</a>). Widgets MAY format identifiers any way they choose (e.g., human readable), but widgets SHOULD either prepend or append the RFC 4122 conformant UUID to the chosen identifier.  In any case, the component sending the message SHALL be responsible for handling errors relating to identifier conflicts generated by the receiving application.",

The desire of Common Map API (CM API) is to provide a mechanism for which developers are able to combine data search/manipulation applications from any provider with map applications from other providers. In order to accomplish this, a standard way for the data search/manipulation applications to be able to communicate with the map applications is necessary. This Application Program Interface (API) is the codification of that standard communication mechanism."
		]

		"title": "Overview",
		"paragraphs": [
			"Using this API allows developers to focus on the problem domain rather than implementing a map application. Developers can simply reuse an existing map application that is compliant with this API . Currently, implementations using Google Earth, Google Maps V2, Google Maps V3, and OpenLayers APIs are available, and others can be written as needed.",
			"Another benefit of this API is that it allows multiple applications to collaboratively display data on a single map rather than forcing the user to have a separate map for each application so the user does not have to learn a different map user interface.",
			"CM API was originally written to be used within the OZONE Widget Framework (OWF) inter-widget communication mechanism to allow client widgets to interact with the map. However, CM API is currently being abstracted away from its OWF specific implementation and reference implementations using standard JavaScript and HTML5 cross-domain messaging have been developed. Some optional extensions may remain specific to the OWF environment, but the core required API specification will be technology agnostic. At its core, messages are sent on channels using a pub/sub model that can easily be used outside of OWF. Messages are sent to the appropriate channels, and the map updates its state accordingly. Other applications interested in knowing the current map state can subscribe to these messages as well.",
			"It is worth noting that the map itself may publish data to these channels on occasion. For example, a map.feature.selected message may originate from an application asking that a particular feature be selected or because a user has selected the feature on the map.",
			"While in most instances the map will not echo back another message to confirm that it has performed an operation, the map will send a view status message whenever the map view (zoom/pan) has been changed, either directly by the user or by another application that sent a view change message. This allows non-map applications to be aware of the current map extent without having to process all the various messages that can change the application's state.",

The current map state can be modified by a data source application requesting that a Keyhole Markup Language (KML) or GeoJSON file be loaded or that the view change to some other location. The map and any listening applications react to these change requests and modify their state accordingly.",
			"When the user manipulates the map, the map will post messages to the map channels, and any application listening to the map channels can respond the changes.",

The Core Specification is the minimum required channels and messages that an application MUST implement in order to be considered Common Map API compliant.  The User Manipulation Core defines those channels and messages that an application MAY implement if it is to support an end-user map oriented workflow.  However, IF an application chooses to implement the User Manipulation Core it MUST implement the whole section in order to be Common Map API – User Manipulation Core compliant.  The Optional Extensions define those messages and channels that an application MAY implement if it wishes to support the identified functionality (i.e., widget intents or clustering).

However, the API supports specifying into which overlay data are inserted, so an application can insert data in multiple overlays, and multiple applications can insert data into the same overlay. To prevent unintended merging of data due to multiple applications unintentionally using the same overlay ID, it is suggested that if an application needs to use multiple overlays, and no sharing of those overlays with other applications is intended, developers include the application ID as part of the overlay ID.  If an application needs to share overlays with other applications, developers SHOULD follow the guidelines in the OWF documentation regarding preference namespaces for shared overlays to avoid unintended collisions."

The feature ID used by the API (featureId) refers to the feature ID given when plotting the entire feature. Sub-features also have IDs but their IDs are only used in the map.feature.selected message, which contains the ID of the lowest level feature selected (if available).  Since feature IDs are required to be unique within an overlay, it is recommended to use an approach similar to the OWF channels:  use a hierarchical naming pattern with the levels of the hierarchy separated by a dot (.). To form a unique feature ID, begin with the ID of the application creating the feature ID. Then, the application can generate a unique number to complete the feature ID. For example, if generating a feature ID from an application with the name of “army.bccs.targeter”, the feature ID’s would begin with army.bccs.targeter. See Appendix D for more information on how to generate unique IDs."
