# CMAPI2 Channels

This is an early draft of CMAPI v2 concepts to be used a starting point for definition of an inital CMAPI 2.0.0 release.  Everything contained in this document is subject to change without notice

## Overview 
Channels define the behavior and data set that will accompany that behavior.  For example the channel "cmapi2.feature.plot" inidicates that a new feature, such as a polygon, will be added to the map.  The data payload that is passed over this channel will contain the actual definition of the polygon.
