/**
* Defines the virtual camera that views the scene. This element defines the position of the camera relative to the Earth's surface as well as the viewing direction of the camera. The camera position is defined by <longitude>, <latitude>, <altitude>, and either <altitudeMode>. The viewing direction of the camera is defined by <azimuth>, <tilt>, and <roll>. An IGeoCamera provides full six-degrees-of-freedom control over the view, so you can position the Camera in space and then rotate it around the X, Y, and Z axes. Most importantly, you can tilt the camera view so that you're looking above the horizon into the sky. The order of rotation is important. By default, the camera is looking straight down the âˆ’Z axis toward the Earth. Before rotations are performed, the camera is translated along the Z axis to <altitude>. The order of transformations is as follows: <altitude> - translate along the Z axis to <altitude><azimuth> - rotate around the Z axis.<tilt> - rotate around the X axis.<roll> - rotate around the Z axis (again). Note that each time a rotation is applied, two of the camera axes change their orientation.

All id values SHALL be unique regardless of type and conflicting id values will be treated as the same element.  Once this ID is set, it should not be changed to avoid references by ID to break
* @property {string} geoType  - This is a value that will be set to a unique string for the spefic type
* @property {string} dataProviderId  - This is a free form string that can represent an ID specific to this piece of data as it is tracked uniquely by the system providing this data.  This is different from GeoId as the GeoId is of type UUID.  Some systems may use IDs formatted in a way that it cannot be stored in a UUID.  In this case, this property can be used by the system to track this psece of data by the ID they use internally.  The GeoID property will be used by CMAPI as the unique ID and this ID is for the benefit of the system providing the data.
* @property {cmapi.IGeoInstance[]} children  - A list of IGeoInstance that are children to this container.  Numerous IGeoInstance objets can have a weak refernce to a single actual instance of a IGeoContainer or IGeoRenderable.  This enables serialization of relationships without having to embed the related objects directly.  In cases where an IGeoRenderable has multiple parents, each parent stores an IGeoInstance which hs instance specific properties such as visibility.
* @property {boolean} readOnly  - Indicates if the object is intended to be read only (true) or allow changes to the values ot its properties (false)
* @property {string} description  - A simple string, or HTML formatted string that can be displayed to describe the IGeoBase.  In the case of a feature the description property can be used to store the content that should display in a pop up window after clicking on a feature.
* @property {cmapi.properties} properties  - A key value pair where both the key and value where the key is a unique string and the value is an object that can be stored as and read from a string.  In cases where an IGeoBase will be serialized all of the values will be serialized using the objects toString() method.  It is the resposibility of the applications accessing values stored in the properties hash map to determine if the value is in a string format and convert back to whatever object type the string was derived from.  The object should not contain any references to other objects where that relationship is expected to exist beyond copying a current value of a simple type as the relationship will not be properly restored when deserialization occurs.  IGeo will not use the properties hash for any internal purpose, it will simply allow 3rd party data to pass additional attributes that will stay associated with the IGeo object as it moves between applications and systems.
* @property {string} altitudeMode  - Enumeration of altitude modes to define how the altitude value in an IGeoPosition alt (altitude) property will be interpreted
* @property {cmapi.IGeoPosition[]} positions  - An ordered list of IGeoPosition objects representing a 1 or more positions with an associated IGeoAltitudeMode to interpret the altitude values.  In the case of a point, a single position will create a single icon, wheras mulitple positions will create the same icon at multiple positions to be interpreted as a composite feature.
